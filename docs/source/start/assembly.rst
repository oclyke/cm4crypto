cm4crypto gets assembled with ease. You just need to:

* connect a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 to the lobby board
* connect the mezzanine board to the lobby board

You may also choose to install additional hardware like:

* install into a Flirc case
* add an NVMe solid state drive
* add a Power Over Ethernet HAT

Here's how to do each part in order.

install PoE HAT
---------------

* align the PoE HAT over the male pins as shown
* press firmly until PoE HAT is seated

install M.2 NVMe SSD module
---------------------------

* insert the module to the connector at a 30 degree angle, ensuring it is fully inserted

   * hook the adaptor onto the standoff hole on the module

      * for 2280 modules use the adaptor w/o a dogbone inserted
      * for 2260 or 2242 modules place a dogbone in the corresponding slot
      
   * from the top side of the lobby (lower) board use two 5mm length screws to affix the adapter

install Compute Module 4 (cm4)
------------------------------

* make sure the outline of the module lines up with the outline drawn on the lobby board
* press firmly above each of the two connectors until you hear and feel a click
* use spacers, nuts, and 8mm screws to affix the module to the board

install a Flirc case
--------------------

.. note:: The mezzanine board must be attached to the Flirc case *before* the lobby board is attached

* insert the mezzanine board into the case
* use three screws from the Flirc case to attach the board

.. note:: Using all three screw holes is important to make the connection between the lobby and mezzanine
  boards easier.

mate the lobby and mezzanine boards
-----------------------------------

* align the top and bottom boards 
* press firmly above each of the two connectors until you hear and feel a click

install bottom tray
-------------------

* remove one screw from the corner of the mezzanine board

  * this is the only screw that is accessible

* place the tray over the case and pcb stack
* replace the screw in the corner through the bottom tray
